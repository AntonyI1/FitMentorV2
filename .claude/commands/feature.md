Define and document a new feature. Do not write implementation code.

Feature name: $ARGUMENTS

Before starting, check `.claude/primed/` for any files related to this feature area.
Use primed context as your primary understanding of the codebase; only read
additional files if the primed context is missing something specific you need.

1. Read /docs/PRD.md for context
2. Create `/docs/features/$ARGUMENTS.md` with:
   - Overview (2-3 sentences)
   - User stories
   - Acceptance criteria (measurable)
   - Technical requirements (endpoints, models, components)
   - Dependencies (existing code this touches)
   - Edge cases and error states
3. Output summary of the feature document created
